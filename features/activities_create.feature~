Feature: Creating activities
  In order to have activities to assign timeslices to
  As a user
  I want to create them easily
  
  Background:
    #Given there are the following users:
      #| email              | password | admin |
      #| admin@timetracker.com | password | true  |
    #And I am signed in as them
    Given I am on the activities page
    When I follow "New Activity"

  Scenario: Creating an activity
    And I fill in "Name" with "Bogus Activity"
    And I press "Create Activity"
    Then I should see "Activity has been created."
    And I should be on the activitie page for "Bogus Activity"
    And I should see "Bogus Activity - Activities - Timetracker"
    
  Scenario: Creating an activity without a name
    And I press "Create Activity"
    Then I should see "Activity has not been created."
    And I should see "Name can't be blank"
